# Blog

Random attempt at converting markdown posts into html for a static "blog". It's p bad, but it works for my small little ramblings. A bit unconventional to build into public dir perhaps, but hey ho. 

## Todos?

- [ ] Posts to directory based on year?
- [ ] Handle loads of posts on index (pagination?)

## Run

```bash
npm start
```
